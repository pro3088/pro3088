 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  My journey began when my father introduced me to coding. I was a naive learner since I couldn't apply what I was learning, so I went to university and my journey took a detour. I still enjoyed coding but was unable to balance everything; I continued in this manner until I began my first internship as a backend engineer. I learned so much during that time; my passion for coding was reignited, and I poured it out. To better my skills, I went on to learn java and data structures.

  I subsequently embarked on a demanding assignment for my senior design thesis. I had a great experience working on this project because it introduced me to a lot of new things.
  I continue to learn, and i will document that journey here for the world to see.
